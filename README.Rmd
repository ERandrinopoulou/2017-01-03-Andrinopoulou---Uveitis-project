# A multivariate mixed effects latent class model

This repository includes the code for a multivariate mixed effects latent class model where the londitudinal outcomes are not only associated with the random effects but also with an association parameter. Furthremore, shrinkage priors are assumed for the longitudinal outcomes.

Specifically, the simulation folder we have:
* "**simulate3a_shrink**": simulates 3 outcomes.
* "**simulate3b_shrink**": simulates another 3 outcomes.
* "**multiMixed3shrink**": includes the JAGS model. 
* "**analysis3shrink**": prepares the data for JAGS.
* "**run3shrink**": includes the main code. Specifically, it loads the packages, simulates the data and runs the model.

How does it work:
* Download all files and place them in one folder.
* Set as working directory in R this folder.
* Run the code in "run3shrink" for fitting the model.
